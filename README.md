# Diabestie
An iOS app to help people with type 1 diabetes who are currently on shots to correctly calculate their insulin dosages.

### Inspiration
My younger sister was diagnosed with t1d at 12 years old. In the months following her diagnosis, our house was a tornado of sticky notes, each covered in hand written calculations for the exact units of insulin needed for that meal or correction. These calculations, though not difficult, depended on a multitude of factors, including her ISF, insulin duration, target blood sugar (BG), current BG, her carb ratio at that time of day, whether she was eating, when she had last dosed, and so much more. I thought that there must be a better way to manage this. With that, Diabestie was born.
